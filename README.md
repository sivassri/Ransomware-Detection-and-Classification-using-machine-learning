# Ransomware-Detection-and-Classification-using-machine-learning
This is a group project on Ransomware detection and classification using machine learning.
The Ransomware files are taken from virushare.com.
The features are extracted using PEFILE module.
Using the derived dataset, Ransomware detection is done using various Machine Learning algorithms.
For accurate results, data discretization is done and the correlated features are eleminated.
After detection, the classification of the file is done using various Machine Learning algorithms.
